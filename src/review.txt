JigSaw|Kuroky|Even though it has a ton of violence a 12 year old who isn't scared can watch this|6
JigSaw|Miracle|I am not the biggest saw fan. But I do still watch them because they are a guilty pleasure for me. It was not a gory as I thought it would have been. It was more mstery which I thought was nice, a little break from all the gore that the other film offer. The acting was okay. I thought they should have picked a different cast but other then that I giving Jigsaw a 7/10 it is the best Saw movie out there.|7
JigSaw|Axel|Which brings us to "Jigsaw," which fails for very much the same reasons as "The Mummy" - It was made to launch a franchise rather than because it was actually about something.|10
JigSaw|BP|It's nice. Love it very much|6
